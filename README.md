Machine Learning Sports Analytics Platform

College Lacrosse Prediction Model

Overview

This project aims to predict NCAA lacrosse game outcomes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical game data, team statistics, and performance metrics, the system generates predictions for game winners, point spreads, and over/under totals. The model has demonstrated a proven track record with an 18.6% ROI on predictions.

Features

Automated Data Collection: Scrapes game data, team statistics, and historical performance metrics from online sources.
Comprehensive Database: Maintains team records, game results, and statistics across multiple seasons.
Advanced Analytics: Implements custom rating systems (Glicko-2 and PageRank) to rank teams.
Multiple Model Comparison: Compares Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms to identify optimal prediction methods.
Strategic Betting Framework: Applies Kelly Criterion to optimize bet sizing based on edge calculations.
Performance Evaluation: Tracks prediction accuracy and ROI metrics over time.
Automated Reporting: Generates detailed HTML reports with visualizations and insights.

Technical Details

The system consists of several integrated components:

Data Scraper: Collects team and game data from online sources.
Database Manager: Organizes data in SQLite with a schema optimized for sports analytics.
Feature Engineering Module: Creates advanced metrics and statistical indicators.
Model Training Framework: Builds and optimizes predictive models using historical data.
Prediction Engine: Generates forecasts for upcoming games.
Evaluation System: Tracks model performance and betting outcomes.
Reporting Module: Creates visualizations and reports for analysis.

How It Works

The system processes 11 years of historical NCAA lacrosse data to identify patterns and predictive factors. It builds team ratings using both traditional statistics and custom algorithms, then feeds these features into machine learning models. The predictions are evaluated against actual outcomes to continually refine the models and betting strategies.

Technologies Used

Python for data processing and model implementation
SQLite for data storage and management
Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning (Random Forest)
XGBoost for gradient boosting models
BeautifulSoup for web scraping
Matplotlib/Plotly for data visualization

Performance
The current implementation has achieved:

12.4% accuracy improvement over baseline prediction methods
18.6% ROI on betting decisions guided by the model
Consistent performance across multiple seasons and game types
